# EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
![](https://github.com/265104/Ltts-Proj/blob/main/1_Requirements/Banner.jpg)
## Introduction
 An employee management system (EMS)is an application that helps you manage your employee's data. The details of the employees are feed into this system and henceforth yoy need not crawl through multiple files and spreadsheets for the details of the employees which thereby saves a substantial amount of time. 

## Functionalities:
1. Accepts the user name and password to login into the System.
2. Accepts user choice of either adding, modifying, listing or deleting the records of the employees.
3. Saves the records in the file created and finaaly reads the data from the file as per choice.

## Where:

**All sorts of small/large scale organisations can use this system of recording their employees datas.**

## How:

**This project is way easier to use to record and generate their employees details and if the data base concepts are applied this system is enhanced and saving of all the data is much more safer. **
